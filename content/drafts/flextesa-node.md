There is one fucking thing wrong with NuxtJs, It's version was so stupid. I made my original website in Nuxt, the fucking nuxt compiler used to take forever to compile my fucking static site, who has that much time. The more stupid thing that happend was was the breaking changes in Nuxt3, Atleast they started to use Vite. I will probably never use Nuxt again. I will make this site with Next.Js, I think it's a better choice to use react than to fuck yourself with Vue versions.

## Why?

Because of my fucking job. I don't have time to make my fucking website. But it'll be soon done.
